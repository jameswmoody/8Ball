# Classic Magic 8 Ball

My virtual take on the classic future-telling game. I used a bit of Javascript and some fancy CSS to bring it all together.

## Instructions

Just click 'Ask' to give the 8 Ball a shake.

## Acknowledgments

Some styling elements borrowed from J. James Rockhill's project found at http://codepen.io/rockhill/pen/EtKsv. I've made quite a few changes to make it fit my own taste but some basic elements are still present. All functionality, however, is 100% James W Moody.
